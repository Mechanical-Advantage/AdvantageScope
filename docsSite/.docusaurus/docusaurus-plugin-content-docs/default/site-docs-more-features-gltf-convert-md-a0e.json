  "description": "AdvantageScope's 3D view accepts custom models for fields and robots, which can be installed using the process described here. All models must use the glTF file format, chosen for its efficiency when storing and loading models. Note that AdvantageScope uses the binary form (.glb), which includes all resources in a single file, rather than the pure JSON form (.gltf).",
