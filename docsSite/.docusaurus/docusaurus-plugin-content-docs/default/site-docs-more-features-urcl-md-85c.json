  "description": "Since REV does not provide an official method of automatically recording data from the Spark Max and Spark Flex, we have provided an unofficial alternative for Java and C++ called URCL (Unofficial REV-Compatible Logger). This enables live plotting and logging of all devices similar to CTRE's Tuner X plotting feature and Phoenix 6 signal logger.",
