# Managing Log Files

## Supported Formats

- **WPILOG (.wpilog)** - Produced by WPILib's [built-in data logging](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html) and AdvantageKit. [URCL](../more-features/urcl.md) can be used to capture signals from REV motor controllers to a WPILOG file.
- **Driver Station logs (.dslog and .dsevents)** - Produced by the [FRC Driver Station](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station.html). AdvantageScope automatically searches for the corresponding log file when opening either log type.
- **Hoot (.hoot)** - Produced by CTRE's Phoenix 6 [signal logger](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/api-usage/signal-logging.html).
- **RLOG (.rlog)** - Legacy, produced by AdvantageKit 2022.

:::warning
Hoot files can **only be opened on Windows** and require an installation of [Phoenix Tuner X](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/tuner/index.html).
