# Custom Assets

AdvantageScope uses a default set of flat field images, field models, robot models, and joystick configurations. Simple assets (e.g. evergreen fields) are included in the initial installation. Detailed assets (e.g. season-specific fields) are downloaded automatically in the background when AdvantageScope is connected to the internet. To check the status of these downloads, click `Help` > `Asset Download Status...`.

The set of assets can be customized to add more options if desired. To open the user assets folder, click `Help` > `Show Assets Folder`. The expected formats for the assets are defined below. See the default set of [detailed assets](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScopeAssets/releases) and [bundled assets](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope/tree/main/bundledAssets) for reference.

:::tip
To load assets from an alternative location, click `Help` > `Use Custom Assets Folder`. The selected folder should be the _parent folder_ where multiple assets in separate subfolders could be placed. This feature allows custom assets to be stored under version control alongside robot code.
:::

## General Format

All assets are stored in folders with the naming convention "TYPE_NAME". The NAME used for the folder is not displayed by AdvantageScope. The possible asset types are:

- "Field2d"
- "Field3d"
- "Robot"
- "Joystick"

:::info
Example folder names would be "Field2d_2023Field", "Joystick_OperatorButtons", or "Robot_Dozer".
:::

This folder should contain a file named "config.json" and one or more asset files, as described below. The config file always includes the name of the asset to be displayed by AdvantageScope. This name must be unique for each asset type.

```json
{
  "name": string // Unique name, required for all asset types
  ... // Type-dependent configuration, described below
}
```

## 3D Robot Models

A model must be included in the folder with the name "model.glb". CAD files must be converted to glTF; see [this page](../more-features/gltf-convert.md) for details. The config file must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": string // Unique name, required for all asset types
  "sourceUrl": string // Link to the original file, optional
  "disableSimplification": boolean // Whether to disable model simplification, optional
  "rotations": { "axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "degrees": number }[] // Sequence of rotations along the x, y, and z axes
  "position": [number, number, number] // Position offset in meters, applied after rotation
  "cameras": [ // Fixed camera positions, can be empty
    {
      "name": string // Camera name
      "rotations": { "axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "degrees": number }[] // Sequence of rotations along the x, y, and z axes
      "position": [number, number, number] // Position offset in meters relative to the robot, applied after rotation
      "resolution": [number, number] // Resolution in pixels, used to set the fixed aspect ratio
      "fov": number // Horizontal field of view in degrees
    }
  ],
  "components": [...] // See "Articulated Components"
}
```

The simplest way to determine appropriate position and rotation values is by trial and error. We recommend adjusting rotation before position as the transforms are applied in this order.

:::info
AdvantageScope simplifies model geometry automatically to improve performance, where the level of detail depends on the selected [rendering mode](../tab-reference/3d-field.md#rendering-modes). In cases where model simplification produces undesired effects with custom assets, two solutions can be used:

- To disable automatic removal of a particular mesh, include the string `NOSIMPLIFY` in the mesh name.
- To disable model simplification for an entire robot model, set the `disableSimplification` option in the configuration to `true`.

### Articulated Components

:::warning
Setting up articulated components can be complex and time-consuming. Consider utilizing AdvantageScope's 3D [`Mechanism2d` support](../tab-reference/3d-field.md#2d-mechanisms), which offers a more streamlined approach to **visualize mechanisms on the 3D field**.
:::

Robot models can contain articulated components for visualizing mechanism data (see [here](../tab-reference/3d-field.md) for details). The base glTF model should include no components, then each component should be exported as a separate glTF model. Components models follow the naming convention "model_INDEX.glb", so the first articulated component would be "model_0.glb"

Component configuration is provided in the robot's config file. An array of components should be provided under the "components" key. When no component poses are provided by the user in AdvantageScope, the component models will be positioned using the default robot rotations and position (see above). When component poses are provided by the user, the "zeroed" rotations and position are instead applied to bring each component to the robot origin. The user's poses are then applied to move each component to the correct location on the robot.

```json
"components": [
  {
    "zeroedRotations": { "axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "degrees": number }[] // Sequence of rotations along the x, y, and z axes
    "zeroedPosition": [number, number, number] // Position offset in meters relative to the robot, applied after rotation
  }
]
```

#### Setup Process

To calibrate the positions of the articulated components, we recommend the following process:

1. Export the base model and components in their correct “default” positions. This is how they should be rendered if no component poses are provided in AdvantageScope.

2. Publish a zeroed 2D pose from the robot code, then select it as the robot pose in AdvantageScope. Switch to the "Axes" 3D field, which shows the field origin.

3. Adjust the overall rotations of the robot (not the components) until the full robot is oriented correctly. Then, adjust the overall position to bring the full robot to the origin. The components should be rendered in the same default positions throughout this process.

4. Publish an array of zeroed 3D poses from the robot code matching the number of components in the model, then select it as the set of component poses in AdvantageScope.

5. Adjust the rotations, followed by the positions, for each component until they are aligned to the origin. For example, an arm segment would be aligned with the pivot at the origin while pointed forward along the X axis.

6. Publish the real component poses from the robot code, which will be based on the newly-defined origins for each component. For example, the pose for an arm segment would be positioned at the joint of the arm pointed in the direction of the segment.

## Joysticks

An image must be included in the folder with the name "image.png". The config file must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": string // Unique name, required for all asset types
  "components": [...] // Array of component configurations, see below
}
```

### Single Button / POV Value

```json
{
  "type": "button"
  "isYellow": boolean
  "isEllipse": boolean
  "centerPx": [number, number]
  "sizePx": [number, number]
  "sourceIndex": number
  "sourcePov": string // Optional, can be "up", "right", "down", or "left". If provided, the "sourceIndex" will be the index of the POV to read.
}
```

### Two-Axis Joystick

```json
{
  "type": "joystick" // A joystick that moves in two dimensions
  "isYellow": boolean
  "centerPx": [number, number]
  "radiusPx": number
  "xSourceIndex": number
  "xSourceInverted": boolean // Not inverted: right = positive
  "ySourceIndex": number
  "ySourceInverted": boolean // Not inverted: up = positive
  "buttonSourceIndex": number // Optional
}
```

### Single Axis

```json
{
  "type": "axis" // A single axis value
  "isYellow": boolean
  "centerPx": [number, number]
  "sizePx": [number, number]
  "sourceIndex": number,
  "sourceRange": [number, number]; // Min greater than max to invert
}
```

## Flat Field Images

An image must be included in the folder with the name "image.png". It should be oriented with the blue alliance on the left. The config file must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": string // Unique name, required for all asset types
  "sourceUrl": string // Link to the original file, optional
  "topLeft": [number, number] // Pixel coordinate (origin at upper left)
  "bottomRight": [number, number] // Pixel coordinate (origin at upper left)
  "widthInches": number // Real width of the field (long side)
  "heightInches": number // Real height of the field (short side)
  "defaultOrigin": "auto" | "blue" | "red" // Default origin location, "auto" if unspecified
}
```

## 3D Field Models

A model must be included in the folder with the name "model.glb". After all rotations are applied, the field should be oriented with the blue alliance on the left. CAD files must be converted to glTF; see [this page](../more-features/gltf-convert.md) for details. Game piece models follow the naming convention "model_INDEX.glb" based on the order that they appear in the "gamePieces" array.

The config file must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": string // Unique name, required for all asset types
  "sourceUrl": string // Link to the original file, optional
  "rotations": { "axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "degrees": number }[] // Sequence of rotations along the x, y, and z axes
  "widthInches": number // Real width of the field (long side)
  "heightInches": number // Real height of the field (short side)
  "defaultOrigin": "auto" | "blue" | "red" // Default origin location, "auto" if unspecified
  "driverStations": [
    [number, number] (x6) // Driver station positions (X & Y in meters relative to the center of the field), ordered B1, B2, B3, R1, R2, R3
  ]
  "gamePieces": [ // List of game piece types
    {
      "name": string // Game piece name
      "rotations": { "axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "degrees": number }[] // Sequence of rotations along the x, y, and z axes
      "position": [number, number, number] // Position offset in meters, applied after rotation
      "stagedObjects": string[] // Names of staged game piece objects, to hide if user poses are supplied
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
