# App Navigation

_[< Return to homepage](/docs/INDEX.md)_

The screenshot below shows the important elements of the main AdvantageScope window. The exact appearance differs between operating systems.

> Note: To view multiple log files simultaneously, click "File" > "New Window" or press **cmd/ctrl + N**.

## Sidebar

To the left is the <span style="color: red;">sidebar</span> with the list of available tables and fields. Selectable fields are shown in _italics_ and built-in tables (from WPILib or AdvantageKit) are <u>underlined</u>. Click the arrow to expand nested tables. **Drag a single field** to select it or **hold cmd/ctrl** to select a collection of fields by clicking each one. Start dragging the collection of fields to finish the selection.

> Note: Click and drag on the right edge to resize or hide the sidebar.

## Tab Bar

Use the <span style="color: blue;">tab bar</span> to switch between different views. This documentation is available at any time by clicking the 📖 icon to the left. To export the current tab layout (and associated settings), click "File" > "Export Layout..." To import a layout from a file, click "File" > "Import Layout..."

> Note: Tabs can be named to identify their contents. Rename a tab by right-clicking it and selecting "Rename..."

## Navigation Buttons & Playback

The <span style="color: green;">navigation buttons</span> on the top manage the tabs and control playback. The "+" icon adds a new tab (this can be accessed quickly by pressing **cmd/ctrl + T**). The "X" icon closes the selected tab (**cmd/ctrl + W**) and the arrow buttons move the selected tab left or right (**cmd/ctrl + [ OR ]**). Quickly switch between tabs using the arrow keys (**cmd/ctrl + ← OR →**).

Playback can be toggled using the play/pause button or by pressing the **space bar**. The selected time is synchronized between all tabs, including the line graph, table, field views, and more.

> Note: To adjust the playback speed, **right-click** on the play/pause button.

## Window Pop-Out

It is often useful to view multiple tabs at once. Since AdvantageScope synchronizes playback across all tabs, it is possible to perform sophisticated analysis by looking at multiple visualizations at once. An example might be viewing video, field odometry, controller inputs, and performance graphs all together. Tabs that support pop-out have an additional "Add Window" icon just below the navigation/playback controls.

> Note: When using pop-out windows, playback is controlled from the main AdvantageScope window.
