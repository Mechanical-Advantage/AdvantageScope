# Opening/Downloading Log Files

_[< Return to homepage](/docs/INDEX.md)_

This section describes how to open log files for analysis.

## Opening a Saved Log

In the menu bar, click "File" > "Open Log..." or press **cmd/ctrl + O**, then choose a log file from the local disk. Dragging a log file from the system file browser to the AdvantageScope icon or window also causes it to open.

Supported log formats are:

- **WPILOG (.wpilog)** - Produced by WPILib's [built-in data logging](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html) and AdvantageKit v2 (2023) or later.
- **RLOG (.rlog)** - Produced by AdvantageKit v1 (2022).
- **Driver Station logs (.dslog and .dsevents)** - Produced by the [FRC Driver Station](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station.html) and saved to "\Users\Public\Documents\FRC\Log Files".

> Note: ".dslog" files include numeric/boolean data and ".dsevents" files include console data. When opening either file type, AdvantageScope searches the same directory for the matching log. For example, when opening "/example/log/file.dslog" AdvantageScope searches for "/example/log/file.dsevents". If found, the fields from both files are combined.

## Merging Logs

Log files can be merged automatically. Possible use cases include:

- Merging DS log data with WPILOG data from the robot.
- Merging WPILOG data from different matches to compare data.

Click "File" > "Merge Log..." or press **shift + cmd/ctrl + O**, then choose a log file from the local disk. The timestamps of the logs are aligned based on when the robot was first enabled (usually the start of the match). This process can be repeated to merge several log files.

> Note: If the logs contain conflicting fields, fields from the merged log will include the prefix "/MergedLogX" (e.g. "/MergedLog0/SystemStats/BatteryVoltage").

## Downloading from a roboRIO

Open the preferences window by pressing **cmd/ctrl + comma** or clicking "Help" > "Show Preferences..." (Windows/Linux) or "AdvantageScope" > "Settings..." (macOS). Update the "roboRIO Address" and "roboRIO Log Folder".

> Note: Click "File" > "Use USB roboRIO Address" to temporarily use the IP address "172.22.11.2" for all connections.

Click "File" > "Download Logs..." or press **cmd/ctrl + D** to open the download window. Once connected to the roboRIO, available logs are shown with the newest at the top. Select one or more log files to download (shift-click to select a range or **cmd/ctrl + A** to select all). Then click the â†“ symbol and select a save location.

> Note: When downloading multiple files, AdvantageScope skips any that are already found in the destination folder.
