## Tab Information

AdvantageScope supports many ways to view and analyze data, organized into tabs. The type of visualization is selectable for each new tab opened, and multiple tabs of a given type can be open at once. Tabs can be named for ease of organization and many can "pop out" to separate windows for simultaneous, synchronized data viewing.
