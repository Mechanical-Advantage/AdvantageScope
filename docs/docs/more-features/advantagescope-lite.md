# ðŸ’¡ AdvantageScope Lite

:::warning
AdvantageScope Lite is only available in the 2027 (v27.x) releases of AdvantageScope on the SystemCore control system. An [unofficial distribution](/overview/installation#unofficial-distributions) is available for use on the REV Control Hub, but is not supported by the AdvantageScope/WPILib developers.
:::

AdvantageScope Lite is an upcoming browser-based version of AdvantageScope accessible from the SystemCore web interface and intended for on-robot development. Most features of the AdvantageScope desktop app are included in AdvantageScope Lite, with the following **omissions**:

- Downloading & viewing local log files: log files can be opened _directly_ from SystemCore and accessed in the browser, but they cannot be saved for offline use.
- Support for some logging formats, including [Hoot](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/api-usage/signal-logging.html) and [Phoenix Diagnostics](/overview/live-sources/phoenix-diagnostics).
- Pop-out visualization windows (viewing multiple tabs at once).
- Exporting and importing tab layouts from a JSON file.
- All features of the [video tab](/tab-reference/video).
- Integration with [AdvantageScope XR](/tab-reference/3d-field/advantagescope-xr).
