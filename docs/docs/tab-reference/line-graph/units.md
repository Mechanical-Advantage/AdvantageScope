# Unit Support

To adjust the units for an axis, click the three dots near the axis title and then `Unit Conversion...`. Select the type of unit and the required conversion. Each value is also multiplied by the "Extra Factor", allowing for custom conversions (like gear ratios, angular to linear conversions, or other units not provided by AdvantageScope). The factor can also be entered using a mathematical expression such as `1.5*pi`.

:::tip
To quickly enable or disable unit conversion, click the three dots near the axis title and choose `Recent Presets` or `Reset Units`.
