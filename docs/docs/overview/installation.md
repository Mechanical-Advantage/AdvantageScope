Downloading AdvantageScope directly from Team 6328 provides:

- The latest features and bug fixes before they are available through other channels.
- In-app alerts when a new version is available to download.
- A built-in collection of recent 6328 robot models for use on the ðŸ‘€ [3D Field](/tab-reference/3d-field) tab.

:::

:::info
Each major version of AdvantageScope is released in January before the FRC kickoff, with a version number corresponding to the year (e.g. v26.0.0 will be released in January 2026). Beta and alpha versions of AdvantageScope may be available in the months leading up to each release, for teams who wish to experiment with new features and provide feedback. **Teams using these prelease versions should expect to see issues and bugs not present in stable releases.**
