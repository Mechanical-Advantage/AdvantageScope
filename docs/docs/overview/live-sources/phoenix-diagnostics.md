# Phoenix Diagnostics

AdvantageScope supports live-streaming of signals from Phoenix 6 devices with **no setup in user code**. This enables easy debugging and tuning of Phoenix devices using the familiar interface and full power of AdvantageScope:

- Flexible visualization options, including support for multiple axes and discrete fields
- Full support for unit-aware graphing, including implicit and one-click unit conversion ([docs](/tab-reference/line-graph/units))
- Live preview of all values in the sidebar for easy browsing
- Support for plotting and signal preview from multiple devices simultaneously
- Decoding of enum values as human-readable strings (control modes, bridge status, CANcoder magnet state, etc)
- Integrated sidebar tooltips with descriptions and units for each signal
- Hierarchical organization of signals, grouped by CAN bus, device, and signal type
- Advanced data analysis with built-in integration and differentiation options ([docs](/tab-reference/line-graph/#adjusting-axes))
